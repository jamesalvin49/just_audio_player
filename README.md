## Playing Short Audio Clips with Just Audio

This project demonstrates how to easily implement short audio clip playback in your Flutter app. By focusing on a simplified use case, we'll avoid complexities like background services, playlists, and advanced playback controls.

**Why Short Audio Clips?**

Short audio clips are ideal for various app functionalities:

-   **Game sound effects** (e.g., explosions, power-ups)
-   **User feedback** (e.g., button click sounds)
-   **Language learning** (e.g., pronunciation examples)
-   **Audio dictionaries** (e.g., word pronunciations)

These clips are typically brief, lasting only a few seconds. While the Just Audio package supports longer audio content like songs and podcasts, this project specifically addresses short clips.

**Key Features:**

-   Utilizes the Just Audio package for cross-platform audio playback (Android, iOS, web, macOS, Windows, Linux)
-   Provides a clear and concise implementation example
-   Focuses on core audio playback functionality
