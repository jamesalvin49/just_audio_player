## Playing Long-Form Audio in Flutter using Riverpod

This project demonstrates how to implement long-form audio playback, such as songs, podcasts, or lectures, in your Flutter app. While local audio files can be played, this project focuses on streaming audio from remote URLs, a more common use case. The core concepts learned here can be applied to local audio playback as well.

To keep the project focused, we'll cover essential functionalities like playing, pausing, buffering, and seeking within a single audio file. Advanced features like playlists and background audio will be explored in future projects.
